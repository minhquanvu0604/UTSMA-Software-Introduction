# Welcome to UTS Motorsports Autonomous Software Team!

Congratulations on joining us! This is likely to be (and recommended to be) the first Git repository you have seen from our team. It contains essential documentation and introductions that you might need to hit the ground running. Like any other GitHub repo of ours, you are welcome to contribute and be a part of it. Once again, warm welcome to the software team of UTS Motorsports Autonomous (UTSMA)!

Your journey with UTSMA starts here. Dive in, explore, and don't hesitate to reach out with your questions, ideas, or if you just want to chat about programming languages.

## Category-specific Resources
We're currently undergoing a significant restructuring within various sections of the UTSMA software team. Our team leads are at hard work compiling documents to summarize what has been accomplished so far. To make it efficient, we hope to align our priorities of preparing the materials with your areas of interest. Share with us your preferred area of focus. Chances are you will be the pioneer in that category!

### Getting Involved

### Development Tools and Practices

### [Docker](wiki/docker.md)

Docker is an increasingly popular tool in the software domain and has proven its usefulness in robotics. By simplifying dependency management and promoting modularity, Docker allows our team to decide and follow on our software dependency standards efficiently. Moreover, Docker's seamless integration and deployment capabilities, with its excellent compatibility with version control systems like Git, significantly streamline the development process.
